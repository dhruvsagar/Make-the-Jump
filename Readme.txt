Game name: Make the Jump!
This game is also on the app store. I have made a GBA version of the app. I claim no rights to the idea of the game.
My title screen consists of an animation in the begenning with an obstacle coming to the center of the screen and "MAKE THE JUMP!" written above
Once the obstacle reaches the middle of the screen, the real title screen is displayed
This title screen itself is a mini-game made to fulfill the 2-D motion requirement of the game
One must use the arrow keys to control the player and guide him over the obstacle and back down
If you hit the obstcale, he will restart in his initial positon.
Once you land back down on the other side of the obstacle, ONLY THEN CAN YOU PRESS START TO PLAY THE REAL GAME  (The title screen is not the real game)
Once you press start, make the jump begins
Press the A button to make the top player (on the blue screen) jump
Press the B button to make the botto player (on the red screen) jump
You must avoid the obstacles for both players simulateously. You score 1 point for each obstacle crossed.
If you collide with the obstacle for any of the two players, the game is over and the end screen is displayed.
You can press SELECT at any time to go to the non-animating start screen (the animated one is only for when you turn on the GBA)
AND THAT'S THE GAME
